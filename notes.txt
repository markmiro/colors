Layouts vs style:
* Layout components get to set the layout styles for their children
  - margin,
  - left, right, top
  - position
  - transform (in most cases)


  // Color Findings:
  // * I want to adjust saturation (chroma). On really desaturated views, sometimes I want to add some, but not for others like mocha
  // * The luminosity diff threshold could potentially be calculated automatically since it leads to low contrast views like rose which causes it to have it's colors washed out since the luminance is so high, and also causes the button colors to not blend as well with the low contrast look
  // * luminosity padding seems to balance out the diff luminosity diff. Making one high can be fixed by making the other lower
